**Be interested in other people.** Ask them how they are, and really listen to their answers... He asks questions because he is interested. And people chat with him because he wants to hear what they have to say.

**Start small.** You don’t need to have a deep, meaningful conversation. If you’re very shy, it’s enough to ask how someone is doing. If you know someone, you might ask a specific question, like “how’s your daughter doing?” or “what are you doing for the holidays?” At a social gathering, it’s always fine to ask how the person knows the host or hostess. The key, of course, is to listen to their answer.

**Keep it small.** Relationships form slowly, one small step at a time. Each new interaction is one more small step toward a relationship. You don’t have to become an orator or engage in lengthy and momentous conversations with everyone you meet. Allow yourself to have brief interactions, and congratulate yourself on each one, no matter how it goes.

**Congratulate yourself.** This is worth repeating. If you are shy, each small interaction may be difficult. You frequently won’t live up to your own expectations. But just trying is important. Give yourself a pat on the back even if you aren’t thrilled with the results. Even extroverts don’t make friends with everyone they meet. You’ve done something hard. Be proud of yourself.

**Gently, kindly, nudge yourself out of your comfort zone.** Once you’ve met someone you like, who you might want to get to know better, don’t think of it as a date. And don’t think about it as the rest of your life. Think of it as an opportunity to get to know someone new and to practice your techniques for dealing with your shyness.
